DSOplotter

I bought the DSO Nano V2 (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/index.php?title=DSO_Nano_v2). Which is a nice, cheap portable Oscilloscope. Only drawback is that it's a little hard to navigate and analyze your data. So to do this i created the DSOplotter which will take the XML file from DSO Nano and plot it. It's not nice looking and the code is not clean but it works for the needs I had at the time (more or less).

Features
* Plot data from DSO Nano on screen
* Zoom in and out
* Measure time using cursors

Binaries available on http://russemotto.com/dsoplotter/

I do some work on it every time i need it but it has been standing still now since the end of 2012. So i thought I would release it to let others use it and maybe get some pull requests :)

Please also send me your XML files if it's not working for you
